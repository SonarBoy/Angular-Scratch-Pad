    <p>Attribute binding in Angular helps you set values for attributes directly. With attribute Bindings
    you can improve accessibility, style your application dynamically and manage multiple CSS classes or styles
    simultaneously. 
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>For example, ARIA and SVG are purely attributes. Neither ARIA nor SVG correspond to element properties 
    and don't set element properties. In these cases, you must use attribute binding because 
    there are no corresponding property targets.</p>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <p>Attribute binding syntax resembles property binding but instead of an element property between
        brackets, you precede the name of the attribute with the prefix attr, followed by a dot. Then you set the
        attribute value with an expression that resolves to a string.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>p [attr.attribute-you-are-targeting]="expression" /p</p>

    <h4>Binding ARIA attributes</h4>

    <p>One of the primary use cases for attribute binding is to set ARIA 
        attributes as in this example:
    </p>
    <button [attr.aria-label]="actionName">{{actionName}} with Aria</button>
    <br>

    <h4>Binding to the class attribute.</h4>

    <p>You can use class binding to add and remove CSS class names from an element's class
        attribute.
    </p>

    <h4>Binding to a single CSS class</h4>
    <p>To create a single class binding, use the prefix class followed by a dot and the name of the CSS
        class - for example, [class.sale]="onSale".Angular adds the class when the bound expression, 
        onSale is truthy, and it removes the class when the expression is falsyâ€”with the exception 
        of undefined. See styling delegation for more information.
    </p>

    <button (click) = "toggle()">Toggle Classes.</button>
    <div [class.onSale]="onSale">This is the On Sale Div it will turn red when the value is true</div>
    <div [class.onSpecial]="onSpecial">This is the On Special Div it will turn blue when the value is true</div>
    <div [class]="list">This is the multipleStyleDiv it has multiple styles when the value is true</div>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <h4>Binding to the style attribute</h4>

    <p>To create a single style binding use the prefix style followed by a dot and the name of the CSS style property 
        for example style.width="width". Angular sets the property to the value of the bound expression,
        which is usually a string. Optionally, you can adda unit extension like em or %, which requires a number type.
    </p>
    
    <button (click)="toggleStyles()">Toggle Styles</button>
    <div class="onSale" [style.width]="width">This is a width binding</div>
    <div [style]="expression">This is a expression binding</div>
</div>
